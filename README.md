# Covid19-Analysis-in-Tableau

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on exploring, analyzing, and visualizing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using Tableau. The analysis involves identifying trends, patterns, and insights from the data to better understand the spread, impact, and response to the pandemic.

## **Features**
- üìä **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualize trends and insights dynamically.
- üåç **Global Analysis**: Track cases, recoveries, and deaths across countries and regions.
- üìà **Trend Insights**: Discover patterns in daily cases, mortality rates, and vaccination progress.
- üìÖ **Time Series Analysis**: Observe changes over time for various COVID-19 metrics.

## **Objectives**
- Understand the global impact of COVID-19 through data visualization.
- Use Tableau to create interactive dashboards for data exploration.
- Provide clear insights to facilitate decision-making.

## **Data Source**
The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from reliable and publicly available platforms, including:
- Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 dataset
- WHO (World Health Organization) reports

## **Dashboards Overview**
1. **Global COVID-19 Overview**:
   - Total cases, recoveries, and deaths by country.
   - Geographical heatmaps to visualize case density.
2. **Daily Trends**:
   - New cases, recoveries, and deaths over time.
   - Line charts and area charts to display growth trends.
3. **Vaccination Progress**:
   - Country-wise vaccination rates.
   - Comparative charts for vaccine distribution globally.

## **Tools Used**
- **Tableau**: For building interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **Excel/CSV**: Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- **Data Sources**: Global COVID-19 datasets.

## **Conclusion**
